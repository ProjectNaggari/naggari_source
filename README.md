Hello! This is a project to catalogue and visualize the books of a nineteenth-century Muslim sheikh in Cairo.
We collected the data in Google sheets in various categories about the printed books of the sheikh. These sheets are turned into TEI XML files and we currently update and costumize this dataset. We will add the manuscripts soon.

The dataset contains both Arabic and transliterated data. We use the ALA-LC standard for Arabic, Ottoman Turkish, and Persian transliteration.

Abbreviations:

D = daftar; the inventory of the heritage of Muṣṭafā Salāma al-Najjārī, daftar dated 24 Dhū al-Ḥijja 1286 (27 March 1870), pages 8-25; cf. Mestyan (2021).

DWQ = Dār al-Wathāʾiq al-Qawmīyah, The Egyptian National Archives.

C = physical or digitized copy of a title.

ALA-LC = Library of Congress transliteration standard for Arabic.

Q = as in undated table, Qāʾima bi-ʿilm al-Kutub al-Maṭbūʿah fī Būlāq, in Box 2, ABC 50, Eli Smith Papers, Houghton Library, Harvard University.
